ODK Survey
==============

.. _survey-intro:

:dfn:`ODK Survey` is an Android application for performing data collection in the ODK 2 framework. It operates similarly to ODK Collect, but is based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript rather than native Android, and is more flexible in its presentation and execution.

.. note::

  ODK Survey only works on Android 4.2 and newer devices.

.. note::

  ODK Survey cannot read or display the forms created for ODK Collect (that is, those created via ODK Build, XLSForm, or other form design tools). ODK Survey operates with ODK 2 Data Management Applications*.
