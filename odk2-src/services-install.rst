Installing ODK Services
=========================

.. _services-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------------

Before installing ODK Scan, you will need the following third party apps:

  - `OI File Manager <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager>`_

There are no other ODK Android tools that are prerequisites to installing ODK Services. However, this tool is a prerequisite for all the other ODK 2.0 Android tools.

Installing Services
--------------------------------

  1. From your device's :guilabel:`Settings`, choose :menuselection:`Security`.

    - Make sure *Unknown Sources* is checked.
    - (On older versions of Android, this setting is in :menuselection:`Applications` rather than :menuselection:`Security`)

  2. Open a web browser on your phone.
  3. Navigate to http://opendatakit-dev.cs.washington.edu/2_0_tools/download and download the latest ODK Services APK.
  4. In the download window, you will see ODK_Services_vN.N.N.apk. - Select it to download the file.

   - On older devices, the APK will automatically install after you approve the security settings.
   - On newer devices, you must go to the download list, rename the file to restore the .apk extension (the extension will have been renamed to .man during the download process), then click on it to install it.

.. note::

  You can also `download the ODK Services APK <https://opendatakit-dev.cs.washington.edu/2_0_tools/download/>`_ to your computer and load it on your device via `adb <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>`_ or another tool like `AirDroid <https://www.howtogeek.com/105813/control-your-android-from-a-browser-with-airdroid/>`_.

.. tip::

  You can also `install ODK Services on an Android emulator <https://github.com/opendatakit/opendatakit/wiki/DevEnv-Setup>`_. However, this can be slow and is only recommended for developers actively working on Services.
